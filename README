This is timing attack demo. Requires Apache Maven 3.0.3 to build (http://maven.apache.org/).

1.
To build binaries execute (assuming that mvn is on PATH and you are where pom.xml file is):
$ mvn package

This will execute maven in order to build jar assembly.
It needs internet connections to download dependencies.
In case of problems with downloads try to re-execute command.
The assembly will be present in directory target/ and bin/ should contain valid symlink.

2. Test it:
$ if [ -f bin/keyczar-0.6b-jar-with-dependencies.jar ]; then echo "OK"; else echo "FAIL"; fi

3. Change to bin/ directory:
$ cd bin/

4. Create signing keys:
$ ./createKey.sh key 0 3
This will create directories key0/ ... key3/ with keys.

5. Then execute server:
$ ./startServer.sh <lvl> <port> kudofile key
Where <lvl> is level 0 - 3 and <port> is port number as you wish to listen.
This will read key files from directory key<lvl> and write kudofile<lvl>.

6. To test the server:
$ ./signMessage.sh echo_test key<lvl> message
$ cat message | nc localhost <port>
$ cat kudofile<lvl>
You should see "test". The <lvl> and <port> must be same combination as in step #5.
